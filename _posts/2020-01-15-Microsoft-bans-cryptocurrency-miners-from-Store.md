Today I was notified, that it is no longer possible to submit updates
to my user-friendly Ethereum miner to Windows Store due to
the new Microsoft policies.

What a shame.

The whole idea of distributing it through the Store was for users to
have a safe place to discover and download a cryptocurrency miner,
as opposed to looking for one on random Internet forums with real risk to
get malware in the package. And yet Microsoft banned miners from their store for
["security"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/store-policies#102-security).
Ironically, that's the same policy section, that bans 3rd-party browser engines.

By banning miners, Microsoft is probably trying to prevent employees in companies
worldwide from using corporate hardware for personal profit. But by doing so
it also hurts consumers, who now have to take the above mentioned risks on themselves
if they want to adopt this tech at home (my wife uses it as a "free" room heater).
They could certainly just have a special mark on the app, and have a group policy
denying the installation, that enterprises could enable, rather than denying
the access to everyone.

Now I'll have to spent a few days developing an alternative distribution system,
and probably will loose a significant chunk of existing users.
IMHO, that policy will hurt overall tech adoption too.
