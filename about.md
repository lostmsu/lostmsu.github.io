I am a .NET hacker, researcher, and the founder of a startup, striving to make .NET
the platform of choice for deep learning.

We make
[Gradient](https://losttech.software/gradient.html), that provides C# developers
the full set of TensorFlow APIs, so they could design, train, debug and run 
state-of-the-art neural networks from the comfort of Visual Studio.
